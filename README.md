### Mana

#### *Pool*

- You have a pool of mana available to play cards each turn.
- Your mana is filled by pitching cards to the pool.
- You can pitch one card per turn, either at beginning or end of turn.

> *(Put cards in the pool sideways, on the left corner close to you.)*

#### *Pitch*

- The pitch value of a card is how much mana it will produce per turn.

It is represented by the number of red spheres at the top left corner.

#### *Pay*

- At the beginning of your turn your mana replenishes.
- Unspent mana can be used to respond in opponent's turn.
- Unspent mana does not carry over to your next turn.

> *(Keep track of the mana you spend using counters, grouping, or turning cards.)*
