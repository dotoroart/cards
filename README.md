# Crossbreed Magic

## *About*

***Crossbreed Magic*** is an adult multiplayer card game where the focus is on creating hybrid creatures and mashing them against each other.

It is a distilation of the most fun elements of other card games, trying to keep the gameplay simple but also engaging. It also tries to very explicitly to entertain a certain type of fantasy. If that is not your cup of tea, well, there are other card games out there. But if you're still interested, I believe there's fun to be had.

This document is the most updated version of the rules. Many things may not make sense, or might change at some point. The game is in early stages of development, and cards are being designed, drawn, tested, etc. For those of you who have access to them, these are the rules in case you want to try them.

# Collection
> How are the cards of the set designed?

- The idea is to have a single set of cards that is able to host a game for 2 - 4 players.
- 120 - 240 cards.

#### Motivation
- The only easonable way to play this with people is if one has the ability to invite others.

#### Extension
- Contemplate a game that could be extended, where players could build their own decks.

#### Possibilities
- Have I thought about leaving the game all digital? Yes.
- Do I really, really, really want to hold these cards in my hand? Also yes.
- Have I thought about doing something with NFT collectibles? Yes.
- Do I have any idea how that could be done properly? No.
- Am I in the right mental state to research this? Maybe... but probably no.
- Would it add anything to the game, other than complexity? Not sure...
- Isn't enough work just designing and drawing the base set of cards? Totally..

#### Reality
- I'm only partly human and I can only bear too much before my mind breaks.
- I am designing things how they "feel right", hoping that magically it will all tie up in the end...
- I hope it turns well!
